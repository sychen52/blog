# Default stuff in a class
There are a default constructor, default destructor, default copy constructor/assignment operator, and default move constructor/assignment operator.
default constructor/destructor is as if you have a empty body of the constructor/destructor. The default constructor will not initialize the primitive type member variable in your class.
default copy/move ctor do some thing with std::memcopy and std::memmove.

# When is = operator=, and when is it ctor.
```
A a;
A b = a; // Constructor
b = a; // operator=
```
The reasoning is pretty simple. The later one is equivalent to
```
b.operator=(a);
```
while in the former one, b has not been constructed yet, so it must be a constructor.

# std::move
It is as simple as converting lvalue to rvalue. The real move (include cleaning up the source properly) happens in the move ctor or move assignment. std::move is just to make sure you can match to those to functions.

# Don't return a rvalue ref, just return a value
```
class B
{
    A a;
    public:
    A give() {
        return std::move(a); // what happens here is that, a is moved to a temporary var and this temporary var is returned. 
    }
}
int main() {
    B b;
    A a = b.give(); // with copy elision, this line does not trigger either copy or move constructor.
}
```
```
class B
{
    A a;
    public:
    A&& give() {
        return std::move(a); // what happens here is that, a is convert to a rvalue.
    }
}
int main() {
    B b;
    A a = b.give(); // move constructor is called here.
}
```
Therefore, with copy elision, return a A&& does not save you anything. However, if you return a A&&, potentially it can be abused.
```
#include <iostream>
class A {
    public:
    A(){
        std::cout << "ctor" << std::endl;
    }
    A(const A& other) = delete;
    A(A&& other){
        std::cout << "move ctor" << std::endl;
    }
    ~A()
    {
        std::cout << "destructor" << std::endl;
    }
};
class B{
    A a;
    public:
    A&& transfer(){
        return std::move(a);
    }
    ~B() {
        std::cout << "B destructor" << std::endl;
    }
};
int main(){
    B b;
    A&& c = b.transfer(); // nothing happens here as well.
    b.~B(); // This is just for demo purpose.
    A a(std::move(c));
    //First of all, A c(a); will calling copy constructor. because [rvalue reference variables are lvalues when used in expressions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reference). Therefore, to call move ctor, you need to do A a(std::move(c)); As a result, two std::move is called.
    // Second, b.a is destroyed first, then c is a dangling pointer. It does not keep b.a alive.
}
```
The output of the code above is:
```
ctor
B destructor // b
destructor // b.a
move ctor // a
destructor // a
B destructor // b again
destructor // b.a again
```

# std::forward
It is converting something to T&&. This is only used in a template function used for relay purpose.
